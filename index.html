        <p class="normal-text">
            Ludwig van Beethoven was a German compouser baptised 17 December 1770 in the city of Bonn, he died at the age of 56 the 26
            of March of 1827 in Vienna, Austria. 
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
            His music is amongst the most performed of the classical music repertoire, and he is one of the most admired composers in the
            history of Western music. His works span the transition from the classical period to the romantic era in classical music.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
            His career has conventionally been divided into early, middle, and late periods. The "early" period in which he forged his 
            craft is typically seen to last until 1802. His "middle" period, sometimes characterised as "heroic", showing an individual 
            development from the "classical" styles of Joseph Haydn and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, covers the years 1802 to 1812, during 
            which he increasingly suffered from deafness. In the "late" period from 1812 to his death in 1827, he extended his innovations 
            in musical form and expression.
        </p>
        <p class="normal-text">
            His first major orchestral work, the First Symphony, appeared in 1800, and his first set of string quartets was published 
            in 1801. During this period, his hearing began to deteriorate, but he continued to conduct, premiering his Third and Fifth 
            Symphonies in 1804 and 1808, respectively. His Violin Concerto appeared in 1806. His last piano concerto (No. 5, Op. 73, known 
            as the 'Emperor'), dedicated to Archduke Rudolf of Austria, was premiered in 1810, but not with Beethoven 
            as soloist. He was almost completely deaf by 1814, and he then gave up performing and appearing in public. He described his 
            problems with health and his unfulfilled personal life in two letters, his "Heiligenstadt Testament" (1802) to his brothers 
            and his unsent love letter to an unknown "Immortal Beloved" (1812). In the years from 1810, increasingly less socially 
            involved, Beethoven composed many of his most admired works including his later symphonies and his mature chamber music 
            and piano sonatas.
