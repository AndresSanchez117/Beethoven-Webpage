            <h3>Rasumovsky</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Was written by Beethoven and published in 1808.
                This work is the first of three quartets commissioned by prince Andrey Razumovsky, then the Russian ambassador to Vienna. 
                This quartet is the first of Beethoven's middle period quartets and departs in style from his earlier Op. 18 quartets. The most apparent
                difference is that this quartet is over forty minutes long in a typical performance, whereas most of Beethoven's earlier quartets lasted 
                twenty-five to thirty minutes. Furthermore, this quartet notoriously requires a greatly expanded technical repertoire.
                To the left we can see a portrait of Beethoven in 1803.

            <h3>An Impressive First Movement</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                It consists of four movements:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Allegro (F major)</li>
                <li>Allegretto vivace e sempre scherzando (B flat major)</li>
                <li>Adagio molto e mesto – attacca (F minor)</li>
                <li>"Thème Russe": Allegro (F major)</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The first movement is in an expansive sonata form, including a fugato in the development and lasting nearly twelve minutes.
                An important feature of the first movement is the delayed emotional recapitulation. As became one of Beethoven's many tools 
                for emotional manipulation, delaying the grandiosity of the recapitulation for several bars after the establishment of the 
                tonic key allowed Beethoven to heighten expectation of a definitive statement.
                To the right we can see a portrait of Count Razumovsky.

            <h3>Beethoven's Favourite</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The String Quartet No. 14 in C♯ minor, Op. 131, was completed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1826. It is the last-composed
                of a trio of string quartets, written in the order Opp. 132, 130.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                It was Beethoven's favourite of the late quartets: he is quoted as remarking to a friend that he would find "a new manner
                of part-writing and, thank God, less lack of imagination than before".
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                It is said that upon listening to a performance of this quartet, Schubert remarked, "After this, what is left for us to write?"
                Schumann said that this quartet and Op. 127 had a "grandeur ... which no words can express. They seem to me to stand ...
                on the extreme boundary of all that has hitherto been attained by human art and imagination."
            </p>

            <h3>Dedicated to Baron Joseph</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                This work is dedicated to Baron Joseph von Stutterheim as a gesture of gratitude for taking his nephew, Karl, 
                into the army after a suicide attempt. Beethoven did not live to hear the work's first performance, the date of which
                is uncertain, nor did he see its publication by Schott Music.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Karl van Beethoven was the only son born to Kaspar Anton Karl van Beethoven and Johanna van Beethoven. He is mainly remembered for being the center of a bitter custody battle between his mother and famous
                uncle after his father's death.
                To the right we see a portrait of Karl van Beethoven.
