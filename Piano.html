            <h3>Moonlight Sonata</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The Piano Sonata No. 14 in C♯ minor "Quasi una fantasia", Op. 27, No. 2, popularly known as the Moonlight Sonata, 
                is a piano sonata by Ludwig van Beethoven. It was completed in 1801 and dedicated in 1802 to his pupil, Countess 
                Giulietta Guicciardi.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The piece is one of Beethoven's most popular compositions for the piano, and it was a popular favorite even in his own day.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Beethoven wrote the Moonlight Sonata in his early thirties, after he had finished with some commissioned work; there is no 
                evidence that he was commissioned to write this sonata.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The name "Moonlight Sonata" comes from remarks made by the German music critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. In 1832, 
                five years after Beethoven's death, Rellstab likened the effect of the first movement to that of moonlight shining upon 
                Lake Lucerne.

            <h3>Sonata quasi una fantasia</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Although no direct testimony exists as to the specific reasons why Beethoven decided to title both the Op. 27 works as 
                Sonata quasi una fantasia, it may be significant that the layout of the present work does not follow the traditional 
                movement arrangement in the Classical period of fast–slow–[fast]–fast. Instead, the sonata possesses an end-weighted 
                trajectory, with the rapid music held off until the third movement. In his analysis, German critic Paul Bekker states: 
                "The opening sonata-allegro movement gave the work a definite character from the beginning... which succeeding movements 
                could supplement but not change. Beethoven rebelled against this determinative quality in the first movement. He wanted a 
                prelude, an introduction, not a proposition.”

            <h3>Für Elise</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Composed in A minor for solo piano, commonly known as "Für Elise" is one of Beethoven's most popular compositions.
                It was not published during his lifetime, only being discovered (by Ludwig Nohl) 40 years after his death, and may 
                be termed either a Bagatelle or an Albumblatt. The identity of "Elise" is unknown; researchers have suggested Therese 
                Malfatti, Elisabeth Röckel, or Elise Barensfeld.
            </p>

            <h3>Lost Manuscript</h3>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The version of "Für Elise" heard today is an earlier version that was transcribed by Ludwig Nohl. There is a later version, 
                with drastic changes to the accompaniment which was transcribed from a later manuscript by the Beethoven scholar Barry 
                Cooper. The most notable difference is in the first theme, the left-hand arpeggios are delayed by a 16th note. There are a 
                few extra bars in the transitional section into the B section; and finally, the rising A minor arpeggio figure is moved 
                later into the piece.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                The tempo marking Poco moto is believed to have been on the manuscript that Ludwig Nohl transcribed 
                (now lost). The later version includes the marking Molto grazioso. It is believed that Beethoven intended to add the piece 
                to a cycle of bagatelles.
            </p>
            <p class="normal-text">
                Whatever the validity of Nohl's edition, an editorial peculiarity contained in it involves the second right hand note in
                bar 7, that is, the first note of the three-note upbeat figure that characterizes the main melody. Is it E4 or D4? Nohl's 
                score gives E4 in bar 7, but D4 thereafter in all parallel passages. Many editions change all of the figures to beginning 
                with E4 until the final bars, where D4 is used and resolved by adding a C to the final A octave. A point in favor of the D4 
                is that the ascending seventh of the motive in this form is repeated in sequence in bars 9 to 11 that begin the second 
                section of the principal theme.
            </p>
